# Phone test checklist

Things that pass tsc / eslint / `npm run build` but have **never been seen on a real phone**.
Test on the deployed https build (not `http://192.168.x.x` — share/clipboard behave differently
off a secure origin). Tick an item, note the date and device; delete the section once it's all green.

## 2026-09-24 — speed (clubs cached, list no longer waits on /activity) — faster on LAN dev ✓

- [x] /matches: public matches appear quickly; your private ones may pop in ~1s later (that is
      expected — `/activity` is the slow call).
- [ ] Opening a match is faster the second time onwards (clubs are fetched once per session).
- [ ] Judge speed on **patchapp.ir after deploy**, not the LAN dev server — dev mode is much slower.

## 2026-09-24 — private matches in the list (verified on iPhone ✓)

- [x] Create a **private** match → it appears in **/matches** (all matches) for you, the organizer.
- [x] It also appears in **/activity** under «مَچ‌های شما». (The live API returns it and the app's
      mapping shows it; a match from before the afternoon backend reset is gone for good.)
- [ ] Someone else who isn't in it does **not** see it in /matches.

## 2026-09-24 — create-match review avatars (verified on iPhone ✓)

- [x] Review step «اعضا»: the **شما** row shows your own profile photo (if you have one set).
- [x] A number typed in «دعوت با شماره موبایل» that belongs to someone in the suggestions list
      shows **their name and photo**; an unknown number still shows the number and a silhouette.

## 2026-09-24 — iOS keyboard (verified on iPhone ✓)

- [x] Login/OTP card stays above the keyboard (`0f0acad`).
- [x] Create-match title field scrolls into view on focus (`5317421`).
- [x] Add-player sheet sits above the keyboard (`b7b35fe`).
- [ ] Other sheets (sort / filter / results player picker) still look normal with the new frame.

## 2026-09-24 — match page review fixes (`bfaffd7`, + follow-ups)

Needs: an organizer account and an **upcoming** match with at least one other confirmed player.

- [ ] **Remove a player — asks twice.** Tap a player's ✕ → a red «حذف {name}؟ دوباره بزن» covers
      the whole chip. A second tap removes them; «در حال حذف…» shows while it runs.
- [ ] **…with a long name** — the red confirm text wraps inside the chip, not clipped or overflowing.
- [ ] **…disarms on its own.** Tap ✕ once and wait ~4s → the chip goes back to normal.
- [ ] **One removal at a time.** While one chip says «در حال حذف…», the other chips' ✕ are dimmed and don't respond.
- [ ] **Removal failure shows.** (Hard to force — airplane mode after arming, then confirm) →
      «حذف بازیکن انجام نشد. دوباره تلاش کن.» under the grid.
- [ ] **No ✕ once the match is live or finished** (organizer view).
- [ ] **«ساخت لینک تازه» on iPhone** — tap once → red «مطمئنی؟…»; wait ~4s → back to grey
      «ساخت لینک تازه». (This used to stay armed forever on iOS.)
- [ ] **Replace the link for real** — two taps → «لینک تازه ساخته شد», and sharing afterwards
      sends a link that opens (old link should say it's invalid).
- [ ] **Hero share pill** opens the share sheet. (Its new «کپی نشد» label only appears with no
      share sheet *and* no clipboard — not reachable on a modern phone over https.)
- [ ] **Hero share pill width** — with ویرایش gone, the single pill spans the whole hero. Does it
      look right, or should it shrink/right-align? *(design call, audit MatchDetailsHeader #5)*
- [ ] **Cancelled match** — «این مَچ لغو شده است» pill is the **same height** as a normal status
      pill (compare with any upcoming match), no dial, no share, no CTA.

## 2026-09-24 — results submit (`6154dd0`)

Needs: a match that was **actually played** — 4 confirmed players by start time, otherwise the
server auto-cancels it. The organizer then gets «نهایی کردن نتیجه».

**⚠ The backend was reset on the afternoon of 2026-09-24 — match `512d9b25` no longer exists.**
Set up a new played 4-player match. (Old note:) match `512d9b25-16b4-4e90-b4bc-e3f33e855c8d` — organizer **سپهر**,
players سپهر · متیوس · پارسا · تست (the `scripts/api.sh` account). Log in as سپهر. On the dev server
the page opens directly at `/matches/512d9b25-16b4-4e90-b4bc-e3f33e855c8d/results` even before the
match ends — which is also how to learn whether the API accepts a result early.
After a submit, the developer can vote as «تست» via `scripts/api.sh` to see the vote shape.

- [ ] Results page shows **one** card (no «+ افزودن بازی», no «بازی ۱» heading).
- [ ] «ثبت نهایی نتایج» is **greyed out** with caption «برای هر تیم دست‌کم یک بازیکن انتخاب کن»
      until each team has a player.
- [ ] Pick teams, enter sets, submit → «در حال ثبت…» → back on the match page.
- [ ] **Capture the result** for the developer: `scripts/api.sh GET /api/v1/matches/{id}/result`
      and paste the output. Its `status` / `myVote` values unblock the voting UI and the
      "result already submitted" state (today the match page keeps offering «نهایی کردن نتیجه»).
- [ ] Submit a second time → note what error text appears (expected: a refusal; we don't know its key yet).
